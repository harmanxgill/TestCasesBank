<h1> Test Cases Bank</h1>

Welcome to the UniCS-TestCases repository! This repository serves as a centralized collection of comprehensive test cases for Computer Science courses taken at the University of Toronto Scarborough. It is designed to aid in the testing and validation of code implementations for various computer science concepts, algorithms, and data structures commonly covered in university-level computer science classes.

Organization

The test cases in this repository are organized by course, with each course having its own dedicated folder. Inside each course folder, you will find sub-folders or files corresponding to different topics or assignments. The test cases are carefully curated to cover different scenarios, including edge cases, corner cases, and common scenarios, providing thorough coverage of the course material.

Usage

To use the test cases, simply navigate to the relevant course folder and locate the test cases for the specific topic or assignment you are working on. You can then integrate these test cases into your code development process to thoroughly test the correctness and efficiency of your code implementations and compare them to my output.

Contributions

I welcome contributions to the TestCasesBank repository from fellow students. If you have additional test cases to contribute or wish to improve the existing test cases, please go for it.

The TestCasesBank repository is open-source.

Happy coding!
